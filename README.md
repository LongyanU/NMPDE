# NMPDE
Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (MATH F422 - BITS Pilani)

NMPDE is a course offered at BITS Pilani University, which deals with solving PDEs using numerical schemes, and studying their respective stabilities and orders of convergence.
Some of the schemes covered are: FTCS, BTCS, Crank Nicolson, ADI methods for 2D Parabolic PDEs, Theta-schemes, Thomas Algorithm, Jacobi Iterative methods and Gauss Siedel Methods

So far, we have covered Parabolic and Elliptic PDEs usually encountered in physics.

The course is a practical introduction to modelling real life problems using partial differential equations and finding approximate solutions using robust, practical numerical methods.
